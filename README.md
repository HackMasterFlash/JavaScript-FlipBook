# JavaScript-FlipBook
A JavaScript based project to animate a sprite based on the first part of a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-game-development-full-course/) "Learn Game Development with JavaScript" by Frank Dvorak. Frank does everything in a video. I had an eye to use pieces of his work in a coding track of [Startfield](https://startfield.org) Academy.

The first part of Frank's tutorial shows how to use an image sheet with multiple images on it as a lookup for doing sprite animations on an html canvas. I thought this was very much like doing an analog flipbook where you draw a bunch of images on separate pages of a notepad and then flip through it to animate the image. This project is the first ~40 minutes of his 10 hour youtube video. Here is a direct link to the section of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c&t=88s).

I'll second Frank's shout out to the graphical artist who created the art for this project. You can see their work [here](https://bevouliin.com/). Very reasonable pricing model for some great art!
